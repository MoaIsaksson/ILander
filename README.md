# ILander
An assignment called ILander.
To move the spaceship use W,A,S,D. There are obstacles that you need to avoid such as a roof and the ground and then planets flying around. 
there are a total of three levels you need to get through. You need to start at the Main Menu scene and then choose the solo playing option. 
there is support for duo play mode but i havent gotten it to instantiate the second spaceship correctly.


i had an idea to make a tunnel type game and i chose to do it in 2D because i really like the feeling of 2D type games. 
it all went rather smoothly i did have some issues, and small hiccups but with more reasearch and with help of fellow classmates i could resolve the issues.

i have used Brackeys videos to figure out how to make a functional Menu and pause screen. i have also used Unity Manual to get information how to to the input system to the controls and the AI navigation example to get the planets to move by themselves and being able to change course.
